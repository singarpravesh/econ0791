## Problem Statement

The superintendent of an elementary school district must decide whether to hire additional teachers and she wants your advice. If she hires the teachers, she will reduce the number of students per teacher (the student–teacher ratio) by two. She faces a trade-off. Parents want smaller classes so that their children can receive more individualized attention. But hiring more teachers means spending more money, which is not to the liking of those paying the bill! So she asks you: If she cuts class sizes, what will the effect be on student performance? 

## {.smaller}

- For a sample of $n$ districts, we can write
$$
\text{TestScore} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{ClassSize}+ \\ \text{Other factors that infulence student-teacher ratio} 
$$

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x+ u
$$

## Estimating the coefficients 

- Data description
  - Consists of class sizes and test scores in 1998-99 in 420 California districts.
  - **Classes:** 6th and 8th grade students
  - **Class size:** $\frac{\text{Number of students in the district}}{\text{Number of teachers in the district}}$ i.e. district wise student-teacher ratio.

## {.smaller}

- **Task:** Summarize the Distribution of Student–teacher Ratios and 5th-Grade test Scores for 420 Districts in California in 1998-99. *This is Table 4.1 in the book. Page no 161.*
```{r}
#| echo: false
# create new variables "str" and "testscr".
caschools %>% 
  mutate(str = students/teachers,
         testscr = (english+math)/2) -> caschools

# summary table 
caschools %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(str, testscr), names_to = "variables", values_to = "value") %>% 
  group_by(variables) %>% 
  summarise(Average = mean(value),
            `Standard Deviation` = sd(value),
            `Percentile 10%` = quantile(value, 0.1),
            `Percentile 25%` = quantile(value, 0.25),
            Median = quantile(value, 0.5),
            `Percentile 75%` = quantile(value, 0.75)) 
```
- Observations:
  - 10% of districts have student-teacher ratio below 17.3.
  - 50% of the districts have student-teacher ratio below 19.7.

- Steps:
  1. Create new variables `str` and `testscr`.
  3. Tidy the data into long format using the variables `str` and `testscr`, and then group them and summarize. You can use `sd()` for standard deviation, `quantile()` for percentiles, and `mean()` for average.

1. Create new variables `str` and `testscr`.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Create new variables "str" and "testscr".
caschools %>% 
  mutate(str = students/teachers,
         testscr = (english+math)/2) -> caschools
caschools
```

---

2. Tidy and Summarize
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# summarize
caschools %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(str, testscr), names_to = "variables", values_to = "value") %>% 
  group_by(variables) %>% 
  summarise(Average = mean(value),
            `Standard Deviation` = sd(value),
            `Percentile 10%` = quantile(value, 0.1),
            `Percentile 25%` = quantile(value, 0.25),
            Median = quantile(value, 0.5),
            `Percentile 75%` = quantile(value, 0.75))
```

- How are the two variables `testscr` and `str` related? Hint:Use scatter plot and correlation coefficient.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
 
caschools %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = str, y = testscr))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Student-Teacher Ratio",
       y = "Test Scores",
       title = 'Scatterplot of test Score vs. Student–teacher Ratio (California School District Data)')
```

- The correlation coefficient is `r round(cor(caschools$str, caschools$testscr),2)`
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
cor(caschools$str, caschools$testscr)
```
